# LUMINA OS v3.0
> **The Sovereign Longevity Engine**

LUMINA is a world-class Bio-Architectural OS designed to neutralize biological entropy. By leveraging **Gemini 3 Multimodal Vision Intelligence**, LUMINA audits your physical environment in real-time, identifying spectral stressors and synchronizing your space with the human Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN).

## 🧬 The Thesis: Circadian Mismatch
Modern urban infrastructure—specifically in high-density smart cities like Dubai—creates a physiological friction. Artificial lighting (melanopsin overdrive) and thermal inconsistency prevent the metabolic recovery required for Stage-4 Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS). 

**LUMINA OS v3.0** solves this by transforming any camera-enabled device into a high-fidelity biological sensor.

## 🛠 Neural Infrastructure
The system operates on a high-speed, four-stage recursive loop:

1. **Neural Ingestion:** 1080p frame buffer capture via the Browser MediaDevices API.
2. **Vision Intelligence:** Gemini 3 Flash performs a multimodal audit, estimating Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) and Lux equivalents.
3. **Bio-Logic Calculation:** The OS references established chronobiology research (Duffy, Lockley, Gooley) to generate a proprietary **Sleep Quality Score**.
4. **Matter Actuation:** Automated generation of Matter v1.3 JSON payloads for conceptual smart-home synchronization.

## ✨ Key Capabilities
- **Sleep Quality Score (0-100):** A deterministic metric of your environment's biological alignment.
- **Dual-State Analysis:** Real-time "Pre-Sync" vs. "Post-Sync" projections to visualize environmental potential.
- **Wellness Activity Vector:** Surgical recommendations for outdoor solar anchoring in the Dubai ecosystem (e.g., Kite Beach, Creek Park).
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy:** Visual telemetry is processed in-memory at the edge; frames are never persisted.

## 💻 Technical Manifest
| Layer | Technology |

| **Registry** | Browser-native ESM |

## ⚖️ Ethical Safeguards & Disclaimers
LUMINA is an educational wellness assistant.
- **Not Medical Advice:** All biological impact calculations are approximations based on research literature, not diagnostic data.
- **AI-Generated Estimates:** Measurements (Kelvin/Lux) are visual estimates, not calibrated sensor readings.
- **Conceptual Integration:** IoT commands demonstrate Matter Protocol possibilities but do not execute direct hardware control.
