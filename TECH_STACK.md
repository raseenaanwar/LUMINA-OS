# LUMINA OS v3.0 | Technology Manifest

This document details the high-performance engineering stack utilized to eliminate biological entropy within the LUMINA ecosystem.

## 1.0 Core Logic & Frontend Architecture
*   **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode) — Ensuring type-safety across high-stakes biological telemetry.
*   **Framework:** React 19 (Concurrent Mode) — Leveraging the latest reconciliation engine for zero-latency UI updates.
*   **Runtime:** Browser-native ES Modules (ESM) — Optimized for high-speed delivery via modern CDNs (esm.sh).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.x — A utility-first engine for the 'Space Black' minimalist aesthetic and responsive grid layouts.

## 2.0 Neural Architecture (Vision AI)
*   **Engine:** Gemini 3 Flash (Multimodal) — The apex of multimodal reasoning, optimized for concurrent visual and textual processing.
*   **API:** `@google/genai` (v1.34.0+) — Utilizing direct AI-to-client integration for low-latency inference.
*   **Grounding:** Strict JSON Schema Enforcement — Elimination of neural hallucinations via deterministic output formatting for IoT actuation.

## 3.0 Telemetry & Sensor Integration
*   **Optical Ingestion:** Browser MediaDevices API — Real-time 1080p frame buffer capture with environmental facing-mode optimization.
*   **Asset Ingestion:** Browser File API / FileReader — Support for external asset audits via high-resolution image decoding.
*   **Temporal Sync:** Intl (Internationalization API) — Surgical synchronization with Dubai GST (UTC+4) to calculate circadian windowing.

## 4.0 Smart City & Integration Layer (Conceptual)
*   **Unified API:** Digital Dubai iPaaS — A centralized gateway for smart city infrastructure data harvesting.
*   **IoT Protocol:** Dubai-Matter — A proprietary implementation of the Matter standard, optimized for Middle Eastern architectural climates.
*   **Actuation:** JSON RPC over WebSockets — Direct control of Lighting (CCT/Lux) and HVAC (Thermal Recovery) systems.

## 5.0 Data Sovereignty & Privacy
*   **Edge Computing:** Zero-Knowledge Processing — Visual data is analyzed in-memory; frames are never persisted or uploaded to central servers.
*   **Encryption:** Cryptographic Hashing — History logs are indexed via non-reversible hashes to ensure user anonymity.
*   **Compliance:** Fully aligned with UAE Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021 (Data Protection Law).
