# The LUMINA Workflow: Automating Your Biology

At LUMINA, we believe the best technology is the kind that works in the background so you can focus on what matters. This workflow is designed like a "Zap" for your health: it connects the physical environment you see with the biological outcomes you want.

Here is how we automate the path to longevity, step-by-step.

## 1. The Trigger: Environmental Ingestion
Every great automation starts with a trigger. For LUMINA, that’s your camera. 
*   **The Action:** You capture a frame of your current workspace or bedroom.
*   **The Data:** We pull in raw visual telemetry—lighting types, screen glare, and natural light levels.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** We automatically sync this with your local time in Dubai to understand exactly where you are in your 24-hour circadian window.

## 2. The Automation Engine: Gemini Vision AI
This is where the magic happens. We don't just "see" an image; we process it through a specialized biological reasoning engine.
*   **Mapping Pixels to Biology:** Our AI analyzes the Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) and Lux equivalents.
*   **Identifying Friction:** The engine automatically flags "spectral stressors"—like that blue-light spike from your monitor at 9:00 PM—that are silently disrupting your melatonin.

## 3. The Insight: The Sleep Quality Score
We turn complex data into a single, actionable metric. 
*   **The Score:** You get an instant 0-100 rating of your environment’s biological alignment.
*   **The Delta:** We show you the "Post-Sync" projection—exactly how many points you can gain by making the right adjustments. It’s about making the invisible, visible.

## 4. The Action: Matter Protocol Actuation
Automation is useless without action. LUMINA generates the "Then" part of the equation.
*   **Conceptual Sync:** We generate Matter v1.3 compatible JSON payloads. 
*   **Seamless Integration:** These commands are built to talk to your smart lights, thermostats, and blinds, theoretically dimming your space to a warm 2000K amber glow for optimal recovery.

## 5. The Feedback Loop: 24-Hour Optimization
Health isn't a one-time event; it’s a habit. 
*   **Wellness Forecast:** LUMINA provides a personalized roadmap for the next 24 hours.
*   **The "Reset" Vector:** We recommend a specific physical activity in Dubai (like a morning walk at Kite Beach) to anchor your SCN and keep the automation loop running perfectly.

**The Result?** A zero-touch environment that adapts to your biology, helping you live a longer, more energized life.

*Work smarter. Live longer.*
